## Data import and cleaning

The categories specified in the data compared to the instructions differed. Here's a summary of the differences:

* There are a number of names without dashes in the instructions but that have dashes in the csv, those are: blue-collar, self-employed.
* A number of columns had unknown as a category, specifically those between marital to to contact and poutcome.
* poutcome had 'other' in csv which is assumed in this report to be the same as 'nonexistent' given this category doesn't come up.
* Day of week column does not exist in csv.
